# pspmigrator: Migrate from PSP to PSA

pspmigrator is a tool to make it easier for K8s users to migrate from
PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) to PodSecurity Standards/Admission (PSA). The tool has
the following features:

- CLI tool to interactively migrate you from PSP to PSA by looking
  at the running pods in a namespace and suggesting a Pod Security Standard
- Detect if PSP object is potentially mutating Pods
- Detect if a Pod is being mutated by a PSP object

Disclaimer: Migrating to PSA might cause new pods to no longer be allowed to
run. So make sure you do test this out before applying PodSecurity Standards
on your namespaces.

Status: Work in progress, usable for testing purposes

## Installation

```
go install github.com/kubernetes-sigs/pspmigrator/cmd/pspmigrator@latest
```

## Usage
Start the migration from PSP to PSA
```
pspmigrator migrate
# example output
Checking if any pods are being mutated by a PSP object
Suggest using baseline in namespace default
âœ” enforce
Applied pod security level baseline on namespace default in enforce control mode
Review the labels by running `kubectl get ns default -o yaml`
There are no pods running in namespace empty. Skipping and going to the next one.
Done with migrating namespaces with pods to PSA
```

Check if any pods are being mutated by a Pod Security Policy in your K8s cluster:
```
pspmigrator mutating pods
# example output
+----------------------------------------------------+-------------+---------+------------------------+
|                        NAME                        |  NAMESPACE  | MUTATED |          PSP           |
+----------------------------------------------------+-------------+---------+------------------------+
| nginx-nonpriv-66b6c48dd5-rl6jt                     | default     | true    | my-psp                 |
| event-exporter-gke-5479fd58c8-k8f5k                | kube-system | true    | gce.event-exporter     |
| fluentbit-gke-4hcg8                                | kube-system | true    | gce.fluentbit-gke      |

+----------------------------------------------------+-------------+---------+------------------------+
```

Check if a specific pod called `my-pod` in namespace `my-namespace` is being
mutated by a Pod Security Policy:
```
pspmigrator mutating pod my-pod -n my-namespace
# example output
Pod nginx-nonpriv-66b6c48dd5-rl6jt is mutated by PSP my-psp: true, diff: [slice[0]: <nil pointer> != v1.SecurityContext]
PSP profile my-psp has the following mutating fields: [DefaultAddCapabilities] and annotations: []
```
